# [Chattitude](https://chattitude.herokuapp.com) backend
> This is a well structured Typescript version of [old Chattitude](https://github.com/thedenisnikulin/chattitude-app-old)

> Also, check out the [frontend](https://github.com/thedenisnikulin/chattitude-app-frontend) of the app.

## Used technologies:
* language: **Typescript**
* web framework: **expresss.js**
* ORM: **sequelize**
* auth is based on **JWT**
* chat is built with **socket io**

I did my best to add as much OOP stuff as possible in this project, so I ended up with a pretty organized code structure.
